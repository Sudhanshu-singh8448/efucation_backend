# 🗄️ Career Guidance Database Integration

## Overview
The Career Guidance service has been upgraded to use **PostgreSQL database** (Neon) for persistent data storage instead of in-memory storage.

## ✅ What's New

### Database Features
- **Persistent Sessions**: All test sessions are stored in PostgreSQL
- **Answer Storage**: Every answer is recorded with question details
- **Score Tracking**: RIASEC scores are stored and processed from database
- **Result Processing**: Final results are calculated from stored data
- **Session Management**: Active session tracking and completion status

### Database Tables

#### `career_sessions`
```sql
- id: VARCHAR (Primary Key) - Session UUID
- created_at: TIMESTAMP - Session creation time
- completed: INTEGER - 0=incomplete, 1=complete
- current_question: INTEGER - Current question number
- realistic_score: INTEGER - Realistic personality score
- investigative_score: INTEGER - Investigative personality score
- artistic_score: INTEGER - Artistic personality score
- social_score: INTEGER - Social personality score
- enterprising_score: INTEGER - Enterprising personality score
- conventional_score: INTEGER - Conventional personality score
```

#### `career_answers`
```sql
- id: INTEGER (Primary Key) - Auto-increment ID
- session_id: VARCHAR - Foreign key to career_sessions
- question_number: INTEGER - Question sequence number
- question_text: TEXT - Full question text
- riasec_type: VARCHAR - Personality type (realistic, investigative, etc.)
- answer_value: INTEGER - User's answer (1-5 scale)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP - Answer submission time
```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/sudhanshukumar/project/backend/unified_backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install psycopg2-binary SQLAlchemy
```

### 2. Configure Neon Database
```bash
python3 setup_neon.py
```
Follow the prompts to enter your Neon connection string.

### 3. Create Database Tables
```bash
python3 database.py
```

### 4. Start Server
```bash
./venv/bin/python3 app.py
```

### 5. Test Integration
```bash
python3 test_database_integration.py
```

## 📊 API Workflow

### 1. Start Test
```http
POST /api/career/start-test
```
- Creates new session in `career_sessions` table
- Returns unique `session_id`

### 2. Get Questions
```http
GET /api/career/question/{session_id}
```
- Retrieves next question from database
- Tracks current question number

### 3. Submit Answers
```http
POST /api/career/answer
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "session_id": "uuid-here",
  "answer": 4
}
```
- Stores answer in `career_answers` table
- Updates RIASEC scores in `career_sessions` table
- Advances to next question

### 4. Get Results
```http
GET /api/career/results/{session_id}
```
- Retrieves all answers from database
- Calculates final RIASEC scores and percentages
- Determines dominant personality type
- Returns career recommendations

## 🔧 Data Processing Flow

```
User Request → Database Storage → Score Calculation → Result Generation → User Response
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓
Start Test → Store Session → Store Answers → Update Scores → Process Data → Send Results
```

## 📈 Benefits

### Data Persistence
- ✅ Sessions survive server restarts
- ✅ Historical data available for analysis
- ✅ User progress preserved across sessions

### Scalability
- ✅ Multiple users can take tests simultaneously
- ✅ Database can handle high concurrent load
- ✅ Easy to scale with read replicas

### Analytics
- ✅ Track completion rates
- ✅ Analyze personality type distributions
- ✅ Monitor user engagement patterns

### Reliability
- ✅ ACID transactions ensure data consistency
- ✅ Automatic error recovery
- ✅ Data validation at database level

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Test database integration
python3 test_database_integration.py

# Test all career APIs
python3 test_career_apis.py
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Health check with database status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/career/health

# Start test (creates database record)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/career/start-test

# Complete full test cycle
# ... (use test_career_browser.html for interactive testing)
```

## 🔒 Security & Performance

### Connection Security
- SSL/TLS encryption enabled
- Connection pooling for performance
- Prepared statements prevent SQL injection

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization
- Type checking
- Range validation for answers (1-5)

### Error Handling
- Database connection retry logic
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Comprehensive error logging

## 📋 Migration Notes

### From In-Memory to Database
- All session data now persisted
- Answers stored with full context
- Scores calculated from stored data
- Results computed on-demand

### Backward Compatibility
- API endpoints remain unchanged
- Response format identical
- No breaking changes for clients

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Update Render with new dependencies
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track database query performance
3. **Add Analytics**: Implement user behavior tracking
4. **Backup Strategy**: Set up automated database backups
5. **Optimize Queries**: Add database indexes for better performance

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Test database connection
python3 -c "from database import engine; print('Connected!' if engine else 'Failed')"
```

### Table Creation Issues
```bash
# Recreate tables
python3 database.py
```

### Data Issues
```bash
# Check active sessions
curl http://localhost:8080/api/career/health
```
