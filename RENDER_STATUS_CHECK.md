# üîç Render Deployment Status Check

## Current Issue
Your API is not responding at `https://education-platform-api.onrender.com`, which indicates either:
1. **Wrong URL** - The actual Render URL is different
2. **Service Sleeping** - The server needs to wake up
3. **Deployment Issue** - There might be a problem with the deployment

## ‚úÖ Steps to Verify Your Deployment

### 1. Find Your Actual Render URL
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Log in with your account
3. Find your `education-platform-api` service
4. The actual URL will be something like: `https://education-platform-api-abcd.onrender.com`
5. Copy this URL

### 2. Test Your API
Use one of these methods to test:

#### Option A: Use the Python Script
```bash
# Edit the script first with your actual URL
python3 check_render_status.py
```

#### Option B: Use the Bash Script  
```bash
# Edit the script first with your actual URL
./test_render_api.sh
```

#### Option C: Manual Testing
```bash
# Replace with your actual URL
curl "https://your-actual-url.onrender.com/health"
```

### 3. Common Issues & Solutions

#### ‚ùå 404 Not Found (x-render-routing: no-server)
**Problem**: Service is not running or wrong URL
**Solutions**:
- Check the correct URL in Render dashboard
- Verify service is deployed and running
- Check Render logs for deployment errors

#### ‚è∞ Timeout or Slow Response
**Problem**: Server is sleeping (first request after 15min+ inactivity)
**Solutions**:
- Wait 30-60 seconds for server to wake up
- Try the request again
- This is normal behavior for free Render services

#### üí• 500 Internal Server Error
**Problem**: Application error
**Solutions**:
- Check Render service logs
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check for missing environment variables

#### üîå Connection Failed
**Problem**: Network or DNS issues
**Solutions**:
- Verify the URL is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Try from a different network

### 4. Render Dashboard Checks

In your Render dashboard, verify:
- ‚úÖ Service status is "Live" (green)
- ‚úÖ Latest deployment succeeded
- ‚úÖ No error messages in logs
- ‚úÖ Service URL is accessible

### 5. Service Logs

Check your Render service logs for:
```
üöÄ Starting Education Platform Unified API...
üåê Server will be available at: http://localhost:8080
```

If you see errors, they'll help identify the issue.

## üéØ Next Steps After Verification

Once your API is working:

1. **Update Flutter Prompt**: Replace the placeholder URL in `FLUTTER_KEEP_ALIVE_PROMPT.md`
2. **Test All Endpoints**: Verify all service endpoints are working
3. **Implement Keep-Alive**: Use the updated prompt with your Flutter AI agent

## üÜò Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Share your actual Render service URL
2. Share any error messages from Render logs
3. Share the response from testing your health endpoint

**The most likely issue is that you need to find your actual Render service URL from the dashboard!**
